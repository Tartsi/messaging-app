# Cyber Security Base Project #1

### Messaging Application

- Simple messaging application, intended to include security flaws.
- README.md will be updated along with the projects creation, to include project setup and information about the flaws of the application.

### Security Notifications:

- Notification in the database table setup file. The password field of users should use proper password hashing, instead of plaintext passwords for storing passwords. This practice protects users passwords incase the database is compromised.
